## Description:
* Opens a window with an OpenGL rendering context. Then presents a polygon 
and provides a GUI to manipulate the colours, perspective, shaders and more.

## Goals:
* To provide a proof of consept cross-platform implementation of an OpenGL 
program using modern features and supporting some major platforms. 
* To serve as a starting point for furture projects and educational purposes.
* Make it as easy as posible to read and modify the souce code.
* Provide limited benchmarking capabilities.
